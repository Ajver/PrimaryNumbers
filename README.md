# PrimaryNumbers

The repo with algorithms that is finding primary numbers in different languages.

Used languages:
1. Python
2. C++
3. Java

I made speed tests for all of this languages. 

### Rules

Algorithm has 30 seconds for find the bigest primary number as it can. 

### The best results

(Those values are the bigest primary numbers)

Python - 3 147 451
C++ - 26 314 307
Java - 32 809 577

For now, Java is fastest from those tree. 

### More info

I runned the same test 5 times. Each time, the only program, that was running was IDE

IDE (for Python): PyCharm Community by JetBrains
IDE (for C++): Visual Studio 2017 Community, release mode
IDE (for Java): IntelliJ IDEA Community by JetBrains
